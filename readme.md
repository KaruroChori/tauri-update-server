# Tauri Update Server
A minimalistic implementation of a server to integrate auto-updating functionality on tauri applications.  
It is meant to support licences to constrain and track the available updates.  

This is a prototype.  
Functionality is not there yet.  
No interface planned to update the db from here, just for content delivery.  

## Usage

- `yarn start` to start the node server.
- `yarn db-auto` to automatically generate models for the database `./private/db`.
